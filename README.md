# NFL Stadiums Gentrification Project

Hello - 

The R coding included in this Git was used to construct my research that aims to predict the impact of the new Chicago Bears stadium in Arlington Heights, Illinois. It uses data from the tidycensus package as well as proprietary data from Zillow ZTRAX. 

Moreover, using this approach, similar research can be conducted for any locale that is facing the impending issue of a new professional stadium.

The approach utilizes K-means clustering and a DiD regression process to compare similar census tracts. The end-user can customize the research based on which US Census metrics are used in the initial exploration. 

So far, this research has been used for:

1. Research presentation at the 2022 ASMA Conference in Indianapolis, Indiana.
2. As part of a forthcoming peer-reviewed publication.
