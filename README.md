# NFL Stadiums Gentrification Project

Hello - 

The R coding included in this Git was used to construct my research that aims to predict the impact of the new Chicago Bears stadium in Arlington Heights, Illinois. It uses data from the tidycensus package as well as proprietary data from Zillow ZTRAX. 

This coding was used for the following:

1. Research presentation at the 2022 ASMA Conference in Indianapolis, Indiana
2. As part of a forthcoming peer-reviewed publication in the Journal of Applied Sport Management
